# Social-Network-API-Model
A social network API created during the UCI Coding.
Allows for the creation of a User, who can posts messages known as "Thoughts", and other users can add replys in the form as "Reactions."
This API contains no front-end and can be interacted with Insomnia.

Technologies in use are:
- Mongoose - for the database.
- Express.js - as backend web application framework.

## How to Run

In order to get this application running, you'll need to install Insomnia in order to retrive all the data and create data from the data base.
You'll then have to run the command "npm install" in order to get the mongoose and express library started.
After that, run the command "npm start" and then the server will be started in the following local enviornment.

- Once the above criteria has been met, do these in order to populate the empty database
    - Create a few users user via post route
    - Add a couple of thoughts
    - Add reactions to created thoughts
    - with new users created, you can now add users as friends.
    - From here you can update and/or delete users, thoughts, friends, and reactions as desired.
